# Autopilot for Tilt Wing Aircraft - Risk-Reduction-Test-Vehicle (RRTV)

## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

This Matlab-Simulink-deployed autopilot is designed as a replacement for the stock PX4 flight controller and guidance system. This provides as
interface layer for all communication remote-pilot functionality.

# Integration with PX4
This is intended for use with my [PX4 Simulink I/O Framework](https://github.com/YevheniiKovryzhenko/PX4_SIMULINK_IO_Framework.git), and it will not work with the stock PX4.
You may also find [KGroundControl](https://github.com/YevheniiKovryzhenko/KGroundControl.git) useful for your communication-related tasks. 

Check out my tutorials on installing and configuring this framework on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgxIoIw6ONumELvafBonHBceTzPIK5T5j)!

# Installation 
This is not a standalone project, you must retrieve the control system package from any of the following repositories:
* [VSDDL Control System and GCS package for RRTV](https://github.com/YevheniiKovryzhenko/RRTV_TiltWing_VSDDL_Packages.git) tilt wing aircraft configuration (proprietary to VSDDL).

Once done, all you need is to:
* Run the PX4_Project.prj file from Matlab to initialize everything.
* Use appropriate project shortcuts to launch GCS and Hardware-deployed control system.  

For control system deployment: 
1. In MATLAB, go to the "Project Shortcuts" tab and click on the "Open Hardware Model". This will open the correct, hardware-ready, Simulink model for controller deployment.
2. In Simulink, go to the "HARDWARE" tab and click on the right-most green icon "Build Deploy and Start". Follow the on-screen prompts to upload the compiled firmware to the Pixhawk board.

For Ground Control Station:
1. Make sure you have installed and correctly configured [KGroundControl](https://github.com/YevheniiKovryzhenko/KGroundControl.git).
2. Make sure you have all joysticks wired up correctly, otherwise comment out the TX block. You may need to manually re-configure the joystick and pedal setup whenever you unplug those or even reboot the computer.  
3. In MATLAB, go to the "Project Shortcuts" tab and click on the "Open GCS" tab. This will open the correct Simulink model for GCS.
